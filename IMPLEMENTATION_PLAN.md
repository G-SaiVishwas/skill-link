# üöÄ SkillLink - Complete Implementation Plan

## Current Status: HARDCODED DATA EVERYWHERE ‚ùå

Everything is currently using mock/hardcoded data. We need to connect EVERYTHING to the backend.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Working (Backend)

### Backend Routes READY:
1. ‚úÖ `/api/auth/*` - Google OAuth, session management
2. ‚úÖ `/api/onboard/worker` - Create worker profile with AI
3. ‚úÖ `/api/worker/me` - Get worker profile
4. ‚úÖ `/api/worker/:id/skillcard` - Public skill card
5. ‚úÖ `/api/job/create` - Create job with AI parsing
6. ‚úÖ `/api/job/:id` - Get job details
7. ‚úÖ `/api/job/:id/matches` - Get job matches
8. ‚úÖ `/api/workers/search` - Search workers by filters
9. ‚úÖ `/api/upload/photo` - Photo upload to Supabase
10. ‚úÖ `/api/upload/voice` - Voice upload to Supabase

### Database Schema READY:
- ‚úÖ 15 tables created
- ‚úÖ Enums, views, triggers, functions
- ‚úÖ RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Full schema in `db/INIT_DATABASE.sql`

---

## ‚ùå What's BROKEN (Frontend Using Mock Data)

### 1. **Worker Onboarding** (`/worker/onboard`)
**Status**: Voice recording works, but doesn't submit to backend

**What it needs**:
- Call `/api/onboard/worker` on Step 7 completion
- Upload photo to `/api/upload/photo`
- Upload voice to `/api/upload/voice`
- Send transcript, skills, bio to backend
- Navigate to `/worker/jobs` after success

---

### 2. **Worker Profile** (`/worker/profile`)
**Status**: 100% HARDCODED - showing fake "Rajesh Kumar" data

**Hardcoded data**:
```typescript
// Line 21-50 - ALL FAKE DATA
const workerProfile = {
  name: "Rajesh Kumar",
  verified: true,
  specialization: "Residential Plumbing",
  city: "Mumbai",
  experience: "5-10 years",
  rating: 4.8,
  jobsCompleted: 127,
  completionRate: 98,
  responseTime: "< 2 hours",
  // ... ALL HARDCODED
};
```

**What it needs**:
- Fetch from `/api/worker/me` on mount
- Display real user data from database
- Handle loading/error states
- Update UI with actual profile data

---

### 3. **Worker Jobs Page** (`/worker/jobs`)
**Status**: 100% HARDCODED - showing 4 fake jobs

**Hardcoded data**:
```typescript
// Line 45-117 - ALL FAKE JOBS
const mockJobs: JobOpportunity[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    employer: {
      name: "Priya Sharma",
      verified: true,
      avatar: "https://api.dicebear.com/...",
      rating: 4.9,
      totalHires: 45,
    },
    title: "Bathroom Renovation",
    description: "Need plumber for complete bathroom renovation...",
    // ... ALL FAKE
  },
  // ... 3 more fake jobs
];
```

**What it needs**:
- Fetch from `/api/workers/jobs` (NEW ROUTE NEEDED)
- Show REAL job posts from employers
- Filter by worker's location
- Match by worker's skills
- Real-time updates when employers post jobs

**Backend Route Needed**:
```typescript
GET /api/workers/jobs
- Get jobs matching worker's skills
- Filter by distance from worker
- Sort by urgency, match score
- Return with employer info
```

---

### 4. **Employer Matches Page** (`/employer/matches`)
**Status**: 100% HARDCODED - showing 15 fake workers

**Hardcoded data**:
```typescript
// Line 29-113 - ALL FAKE WORKERS
const mockWorkers: Worker[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "Rajesh Kumar",
    skills: ["Plumbing", "Pipe Installation"],
    experience: "5-10 years",
    rating: 4.8,
    // ... ALL FAKE
  },
  // ... 14 more fake workers
];
```

**What it needs**:
- When employer creates job, show real matched workers
- Call `/api/job/:id/matches` to get workers
- Display real worker profiles from database
- Click worker card ‚Üí view real skill card
- Send contact request to real workers

---

### 5. **Employer Post Job** (`/employer/post`)
**Status**: Form exists but doesn't submit

**What it needs**:
- Call `/api/job/create` on submit
- Upload voice if provided
- AI parses job description
- Navigate to `/employer/matches/:jobId`
- Show matched workers immediately

---

### 6. **Employer Settings** (`/employer/settings`)
**Status**: Has comment "Mock data - replace with actual data from API"

**What it needs**:
- Fetch from `/api/employer/me` (NEW ROUTE NEEDED)
- Update employer profile
- Manage subscription
- Update payment methods

---

## üî• CRITICAL MISSING BACKEND ROUTES

### 1. **GET `/api/workers/jobs`**
Get job opportunities for logged-in worker

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "employer": {
        "name": "Priya Sharma",
        "org_name": "Sharma Construction",
        "verified": true,
        "rating": 4.9,
        "photo_url": "https://..."
      },
      "title": "Bathroom Renovation",
      "description": "...",
      "skills_required": ["plumbing", "bathroom-fitting"],
      "location": {
        "city": "Mumbai",
        "distance_km": 5.2
      },
      "urgency": "high",
      "created_at": "2025-10-29T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **GET `/api/employer/me`**
Get logged-in employer's profile

### 3. **PATCH `/api/employer/:id`**
Update employer profile

### 4. **POST `/api/match/contact`**
Employer contacts a worker

### 5. **GET `/api/worker/matches`**
Get workers who matched with employer's job
