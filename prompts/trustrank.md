# TrustRank Computation Prompt

## Purpose
Produce an interpretable trust score using available signals for worker reputations inside SkillLink.

## Prompt Template
```
You are SkillLink's TrustRank analyst. Given structured metrics for a worker, compute a trustworthy score from 0 to 100 and explain the rationale.

### Signals
- Voice Sentiment Score (0-1): {{voice_sentiment_score}}
- Verification Count (integer): {{verification_count}}
- Recent Rating Average (1-5 or null): {{rating_average}}
- Completed Jobs (integer): {{completed_jobs}}
- Account Age Days: {{account_age_days}}
- Flags: {{flags}}

### Requirements
1. Apply the following heuristic formula (documented for engineers):
   - Base = 40
   - Sentiment Contribution = voice_sentiment_score * 20
   - Verification Contribution = min(verification_count, 5) * 4
   - Rating Contribution = (coalesce(rating_average, 4) - 3) * 12
   - Account Age Contribution = least(account_age_days / 30, 6)
   - Penalty: subtract 10 if `flags` includes "dispute" or "unverified"; subtract 5 if includes "low_response".
   - Clamp final score between 0 and 100.
2. Provide `score_breakdown` array describing each component in plain English.
3. Suggest top 2 actions to improve trust.
4. Output as JSON:
{
  "score": number,
  "score_breakdown": string[],
  "recommendations": string[]
}

Respond with JSON only.
