# Voice to Skills Extraction Prompt

## Purpose
Transform a transcribed onboarding voice note into structured worker skill insights for SkillLink.

## Prompt Template
```
You are SkillLink's Skill Extractor. Analyze the following transcript from an informal worker describing their experience. Return a strict JSON object.

### Transcript
{{transcript}}

### Location Details
City: {{city}}
Country: {{country}}

### Expectations
- Identify actionable `tags` that map to worker skills (camelCase slugs where possible).
- Estimate `experience_years` as a number (can be fractional) when stated or implied. Use 0.5 if unknown.
- List `languages_spoken` as ISO language names.
- Suggest up to three `preferred_roles` for matching (short phrases).
- Provide a `confidence` score between 0 and 1 reflecting certainty of the extraction.
- Include `notes` with any nuances (max 280 chars).

### Output JSON Schema
{
  "tags": string[],
  "experience_years": number,
  "languages_spoken": string[],
  "preferred_roles": string[],
  "confidence": number,
  "notes": string
}

Respond with JSON only. If information is missing, make a best-effort grounded estimate and add rationale in `notes`.
