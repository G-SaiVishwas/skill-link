## How to Test

- ‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Safari (macOS/iOS)

**Not Supported:**

## What Happens Next

The voice transcript is saved in `formData.voiceTranscript` and will be used for:

1. **Skill Extraction** (Step 4) - AI will analyze transcript to suggest skills
2. **Bio Generation** (Step 6) - AI will create professional bio from your intro
3. **SkillCard Creation** - Your voice intro becomes part of your profile

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
formData.voiceTranscript: string  // Stores final transcript
isListening: boolean              // Recording state
interimTranscript: string         // Live preview
recordingDuration: number         // Timer (0-15 seconds)
```

### Key Functions
- `startListening()` - Starts Web Speech API recognition
- `stopListening()` - Stops recording and saves transcript
- `resetTranscript()` - Clears everything for re-recording
- `handleReRecord()` - Resets formData and transcript

4. **Audio File Upload** option (for users who prefer file upload)
5. **Multiple Language Support** (Spanish, Hindi, etc.)
